								smoke alarm to alert them to a fire. There are a couple different accessories on the market that can be purchased for
								people who are deaf or hard of hearing. A member of the Fire Prevention Bureau is also available if you would like them
								to come out and inspect your home and go over smoke alarm options. You can contact the Fire Prevention Bureau at

							Effective January 1, 2007, every dwelling unit will be required to have at least one approved carbon monoxide alarm in an
							operating condition within 15 feet of every room used for sleeping purposes. Alarms can be battery powered, plug-in with
							battery back-up or wired into the AC power line with a secondary battery back-up. The alarm can be combined with smoke
							detecting devices if the combined unit complies with specific standards and the alarm differentiates the hazard.

							<p>
								The Illinois General Assembly has passed and the Govenor has signed the Carbon Monoxide Alarm Detector Act (Public Act
								094-0741). This new law, effective January 1, 2007, requires homeowners and landlords to install carbon monoxide
								detectors in all buildings containing bedrooms and sleeping facilities. The Primary Features of the Law are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Every "dwelling unit" must be equipped with at least one operable carbon monoxide alarm within 15 feet of every
									room used for sleeping purposes.
								</li>
								<li>
									The alarm may be combined with smoke detecting devices provided the unit complies with respective standards and the
									alarm differentiates the hazard.
								</li>
								<li>
									A "dwelling unit" means a room or suite of rooms used for human habitation, and includes single family residences,
									multiple family residences and mixed use buildings.
								</li>
								<li>
									If a structure contains more than one "dwelling unit," an alarm must be installed within 15 feet of every sleeping
									room in each "dwelling unit."
								</li>
								<li>
									The owner must supply and install all required alarms. A landlord must ensure that the alarms are operable on the
									date of initiation of a lease. The tenant is responsible for testing and maintaining the alarm after the lease
									commences.
								</li>
								<li>
									A landlord is required to furnish one tenant per dwelling unit with written information regarding alarm testing and
									maintenance.
								</li>
								<li>
									Willful failure to install and maintain in operating condition any alarm is a Class B criminal misdemeanor. The Act
									does exempt certain residential units from the requirement. Those residential units in a building that (1) does not
									rely on combustion of fossil fuel for heat, ventilation or hot water and (2) is not connected to a garage.
								</li>
