											Neighborhood Watch
										</h4>
										<p>
											The Bolingbrook Police Department Crime Prevention Unit is seeking new areas in
											which to start a Neighborhood Watch Program. Neighborhood Watch is a cooperative
											effort within each community, where neighbors agree to watch each other's homes and
											property. Starting one in your area is simple:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Contact your neighbors and see if they are willing to participate in the program.
												If 70% of your neighbors agree to participate, you will be eligible to have
												Neighborhood Watch signs posted on your street to let everyone know that the
												neighborhood is watching them.
											</li>
											<li>Call the Crime Prevention Office and set up a meeting in one of your homes.</li>
											<li>
												Learn more about the program at the meeting, as well as some of the steps you can
												take to make your neighborhood safer.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											With the warm weather approaching, the time to get this effective program going is
											now! If you currently have a Neighborhood Watch Program in your area or if you are a
											Block Captain, call and set up an appointment for a follow-up meeting or to meet
											your Crime Prevention Officer. Neighborhood Watch is presented on request of local
											neighborhood groups. We currently have approximately 100 groups encompassing about
											2200 homes. If you have an existing Watch Program in your area and have not met with
											the Crime Prevention Unit in the past two years, PLEASE call to update your area's
											program!

									<h1 class="display-6">Vehicle Burglary</h1>
									<p>
										One of the more frequent crimes reported to the police department is burglary to a
										vehicle. Sometimes offenders enter a vehicle through an unlocked door or by breaking a
										window looking for valuables that are left in plain view. Some of the most popular
										items stolen are briefcases, cameras, cell phones, global positioning systems (GPS),
										I-Passes, I-Pods, purses, radar detectors and wallets.
									</p>
									<p>
										Here are some simple rules that can help deter and protect you from being a victim of
										this crime:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											When you park your vehicle at home or away, close your windows and lock doors, even
											if you’re going to be gone for a short time.
										</li>
										<li>Always park in a well-lit area.</li>
										<li>
											If you have a garage, use it! If you have to park your vehicle in your driveway
											overnight, leave on exterior house lights. Good lighting is one of the most
											efficient &amp; least expensive means of security.
										</li>
										<li>
											Notify the police department of any suspicious people or activities in your
											neighborhood.
										</li>
