							<h2>Cyber Secure at Work</h2>
							<p>
								Businesses face significant financial loss when a cyber-attack occurs. In 2020, a sharp
								increase was reported in cyber-attacks that target businesses using stolen logins and
								passwords.1 Cybercriminals often rely on human error—employees failing to install
								software patches or clicking on malicious links—to gain access to systems. From the top
								leadership to the newest employee, cybersecurity requires the vigilance of everyone to
								keep data, customers, and capital safe and secure. #BeCyberSmart to connect with
								confidence and support a culture of cybersecurity at your organization.

							<p>
								In a world where we are constantly connected, cybersecurity cannot be limited to the
								home or office. When you’re traveling— whether domestic or international—it is always
								important to practice safe online behavior and take proactive steps to secure
								Internet-enabled devices. The more we travel, the more we are at risk for cyberattacks.
								#BeCyberSmart and use these tips to connect with confidence while on the go.

							<h2>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
							<p>
								Have you noticed how often security breaches, stolen data, and identity theft are
								consistently front-page news these days? Perhaps you, or someone you know, are a victim
								of cyber criminals who stole personal information, banking credentials, or more. As
								these incidents become more prevalent, you should consider using multi-factor
								authentication, also called strong authentication, or two-factor authentication. This
								technology may already be familiar to you, as many banking and financial institutions
								require both a password and one of the following to log in: a call, email, or text
								containing a code. By applying these principles of verification to more of your personal
								accounts, such as email, social media, and more, you can better secure your information
								and identity online!

							<h2>Online Privacy</h2>
							<p>
								The Internet touches almost all aspects of our daily lives. We are able to shop, bank,
								connect with family and friends, and handle our medical records all online. These
								activities require you to provide personally identifiable information (PII) such as your
								name, date of birth, account numbers, passwords, and location information. #BeCyberSmart
								when sharing personal information online to reduce the risk of becoming a cybercrimes
								victim.

							<h2>Protecting Your Digital Home</h2>
							<p>
								More of our home devices—including thermostats, door locks, coffee machines, and smoke
								alarms—are now connected to the Internet. This enables us to control devices on our
								smartphones which can save us time and money while providing convenience and even
								safety. These advances in technology are innovative and intriguing, however they also
								pose a new set of security risks. #BeCyberSmart to connect with confidence and protect

								incident.
